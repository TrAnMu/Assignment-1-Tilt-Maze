Programming Assignment 1, Part 1

A. Required Elements
- Use either the arrow keys or "WASD" to tilt the board
- Maneuver the ball into the black circle to win
- Hit 'q' to quit
- Hit 'r' to restart
- I allow a maximum tilt of ~10 degrees in any direction

B. Additional Elements
- Particles flow vertically with respect to the world and not the particle filter. 
- Lights do not dim after reset (Lighting is baked once).

C. Known Issues
- The tilt limit occasionally allows the x and z to exceed the limit, causing controls to lock up. I can usually wrestle back control with some fiddling but I would continue trying to fix it.

D. External Resources
- None.
